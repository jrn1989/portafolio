Hello, my name is Jos√© and I'm a Data Scientist from Mexico City.

I personally love how data, math and technology are interwined, that's why after I finished my bachelor's degree in Computer Science I went to study my master's degree in Data Mining.

I'm building this website to showcase some fun projects I come across with in my spare time and also to have the chance to show off some of my skills: web scraping, data collection, data wrangling, data exploration, data visualization, ML, R, Python, SQL and researching relevant data science topics.

Feel free to download my CV and get to know more about my professional experience
